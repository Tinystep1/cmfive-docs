## Introduction

Cmfive core modules provide underlying functionality common to all installations.
This includes:
 - fundamental tools for site admin
 - high level menus, actions and forms for users
 - low level services based support for object interactions

They are installed in the modules folder of core, by a symlink from the boilerplate system folder. For detailed information, choose modules by name from the menu.
