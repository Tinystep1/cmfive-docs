## Cmfive


Cmfive
 â€“ an open source Business Application framework (ERP, CRM, MIS)

Cmfive is a ready to go, open source system that supports data capture and workflow integration between multiple business units or departments in any organisation.  Designed to work with custom and off-the-shelf ERP, CRM and MIS systems, Cmfive is the perfect tool to tackle challenging integrations between non-communicating business systems, or, to engineer an entirely new module or extension of an existing IT platform.
