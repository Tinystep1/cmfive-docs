## Introduction

Cmfive core is the PHP codebase for content generation.  
It manages:
 - serving http requests by PHP actions and objects
 - template based response generation
 - service calls between PHP objects
 - event handling relationships between PHP objects
 - application of PHP objects in modules for high level services
 - abstraction of code objects into database storage
 - abstractions for users, sessions and security
 
It is installed by a symlink from the boilerplate system folder.
