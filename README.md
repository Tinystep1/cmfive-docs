# The Cmfive site refresh
--------------------------------------------------

Now using Github pages powered by Jekyll
(Commenced 2019)

Features:
 - All documentation can be truly open source - just like Cmfive
 - The site is only comprised of static components (HTML, CSS, JS) with no dynamic parts
        The advantage of this is that there are minial security risks
 - Hosting backed by Github
 - Versions of documents are maintained 
		Can be mapped to different versions of Cmfive through the use of branches
 - Editing documentation is much easier to do via the use of pull requests
 - Ongoing effort to update all of the Cmfive documentation and migrate it to this new set up

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
# To host this Jekyll repository locally with Docker:
--------------------------------------------------

 - install Docker including Docker-Compose (at least version 2.1)
 - clone-or-pull this repository into a local file directory
 - from your local file directory, run "Win" or "Lin" versions of:
   - DockerRun / DockerQuit / DockerRemove
   - Will start, stop, and revoke the Jekyll_Docker service
   - eg: './DockerRunLin' from bash or 'DockerRunWin' from cmd 
 - aim your browser at 'https://localhost:4000/' to see pages served 
   - (you will likely need to let your browser accept the self signed cert.)

# Forty - Jekyll Theme

A Jekyll version of the "Forty" theme by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).  

![Forty Theme](assets/images/forty.jpg "Forty Theme")

# How to Use

For those unfamiliar with how Jekyll works, check out [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/) for all the details, 
or read up on just the basics of [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), [writing posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/), 
and [creating pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/).

- **GitLab**: Simply fork this repository and start editing the `_config.yml` file!  
- **GitHub**: Fork this repository and create a branch named `gh-pages`, then start editing the `_config.yml` file.

## Starting Jekyll locally

The config requires SSL be set up, you can comment out that line, or use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to generate a local SSL cert then reference them when you launch Jekyll: 

```
$ jekyll serve --ssl-key=localhost-key.pem --ssl-cert=localhost.pem --trace --config=_config.yml,_config_development.yml
```

When launching, it's important to specify the ```--config``` option with reference to the ```_config_development.yml``` in addition to the base ```_config.yml``` file. This stops Jekyll setting the base URL to https://cmfive.com.

# Added Features

* **[Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) contact form integration** - just add your email to the `_config.yml` and it works!
* Use `_config.yml` to **set whether the homepage tiles should pull pages or posts**, as well as how many to display.
* Add your **social profiles** easily in `_config.yml`. Only social profiles buttons you enter in `config.yml` show up on the site footer!
* Set **featured images** in front matter.

# Issues

This is Forty, my latest and greatest addition to HTML5 UP and, per its incredibly
creative name, my 40th (woohoo)! It's built around a grid of "image tiles" that are
set up to smoothly transition to secondary landing pages (for which a separate page
template is provided), and includes a number of neat effects (check out the menu!),
extra features, and all the usual stuff you'd expect. Hope you dig it!
