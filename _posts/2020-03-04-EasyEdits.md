title: Cmfive documentation progress
description: Easier collaboration with Docker
---

The Cmfive documentation repository has been extended to provide Docker configurations for local Jekyll hosting. Now it is easy to set up a local project for contributing content, and to preview your working changes.

The distinction between main documentation and tutorials has been exemplified, and documentation is being provided for the Cmfive test framework. (Codeception UA tests.)

Onward, as we update all of the Cmfive documentation and migrate it to this new set up. This may take some time so we appreciate your patience.
