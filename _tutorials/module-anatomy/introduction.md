## Working with modules

Cmfive modules consist of a fixed structure and are located in the boilerplate modules folder.
To get started you can either create a module repository directly in the cmfive-boilerplate/modules folder or create a symbolic link to your external module repository.
The module name must be all lower case and must match the name in the module config and service class. This will be explained further.

To start your module create a new folder called 'example' in cmfive-boilerplate/modules.
Your next step will be to generate the module config file. Click next to see these instructions.
